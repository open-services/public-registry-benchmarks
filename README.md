### List of registries

Here is a list of some public npm registries:

- https://registry.yarnpkg.com
- https://registry.node-modules.io
- https://r.cnpmjs.org
- https://registry.js.ipfs.io

### `tests/`

The `tests/` directory contains one Dockerfile per test. The Dockerfile
sets everything up for the test. The naming convention is "$registry--$client"
so `npm--npm` would mean using the `npm` client to request from `registry.npmjs.org`,
the file `yarn--npm` would mean using the `npm` client to request from `registry.yarnpkg.com`
