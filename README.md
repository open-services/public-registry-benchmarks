### List of registries

Here is a list of some public npm registries:

- https://registry.npmjs.org
- https://registry.yarnpkg.com
- https://registry.node-modules.io
- https://r.cnpmjs.org
- https://registry.js.ipfs.io
- http://registry.npmjs.eu - Broken: self-signed cert
- https://registry.nodejitsu.com - Broken: no response
- https://npm.strongloop.com - Broken: invalid cert

## Adding new registries/clients

You can add your own registry/client if you follow the format in
`generate-tests.clj` and send a PR.

### `tests/`

The `tests/` directory contains one Dockerfile per test. The Dockerfile
sets everything up for the test. The naming convention is "$registry--$client"
so `npm--npm` would mean using the `npm` client to request from `registry.npmjs.org`,
the file `yarn--npm` would mean using the `npm` client to request from `registry.yarnpkg.com`

All of these are generated from running `clojure generate-tests.clj`, so don't
change them directly.
